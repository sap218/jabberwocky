No thanks, I'm, trying to catch a flying type in the mountatins with the clear air.
I'll be there soon. Need to heal first.
Currently on the opposite path, training for Brock's gym.
I'll join too - it'll be nice for Ekans to get some practice - I'll be flying by air.
Really? Still with an Ekans? Any chance it'll evolve soon?.
Not yet. Taking is slow - Team Rocket are after one.
So where are you guys meeting again?
Remember to be careful everyone! If you see any grunts of Team Rocket please notify us via your pokedex. We are always alert on the path if you need assistance.
Feel free to pop in the centre if you want to rest.
I need one for my pokedex - luckily I'm only a few minutes away, I won't be too long, just coming down the path now.
Hurry it'll mega-evolve! The other one flew away and I was too late.
What is mega-evolve?
What?! You've not heard of it?!
Drat! I didn't know it took a while for Magikarps to evolve.
Not sure.
Do you mean cat-breed pokemon?
The path near the school is always a good choice.
