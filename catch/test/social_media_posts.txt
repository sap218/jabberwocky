Any small pokemon nearby? I need to catch a Metapod!
I think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path - try route 2.
I've checked that route twice already. I just want my Caterpie to evolve already.

Anyone else dislike the new Pokedex? What happened to old fashioned gen 1?

Anyone want a battle? I'm on route 13.
No thanks, I'm, trying to catch a flying type in the mountatins with the clear air.
I'll be there soon. Need to heal first.
Currently on the opposite path, training for Brock's gym.
I'll join too - it'll be nice for Ekans to get some practice - I'll be flying by air.
Really? Still with an Ekans? Any chance it'll evolve soon?.
Not yet. Taking is slow - Team Rocket are after one.
I'll join but we should move to the meadow area near that route.
So where are you guys meeting again?

Remember to be careful everyone! If you see any grunts of Team Rocket please notify us via your pokedex. We are always alert on the path if you need assistance.
Feel free to pop in the centre if you want to rest.

Hey guys! Lake near route 7 I saw a Gyarados!
I need one for my pokedex - luckily I'm only a few minutes away, I won't be too long, just coming down the path now.
Hurry it'll mega-evolve! The other one flew away and I was too late.
What is mega-evolve?
What?! You've not heard of it?!
Drat! I didn't know it took a while for Magikarps to evolve.

What route is best for small normal pokemon? My Skitty needs a friend.
Not sure.
Do you mean cat-breed pokemon?
The path near the school is always a good choice.
Go to route 4, we're totally not on that path and we don't plan on catching your Skitty away from you.
