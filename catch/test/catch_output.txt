Any small pokemon nearby? I need to catch a Metapod!
I think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path - try route 2.
I've checked that route twice already. I just want my Caterpie to evolve already.
Anyone else dislike the new Pokedex? What happened to old fashioned gen 1?
Anyone want a battle? I'm on route 13.
No thanks, I'm, trying to catch a flying type in the mountatins with the clear air.
I'll join too - it'll be nice for Ekans to get some practice - I'll be flying by air.
I'll join but we should move to the meadow area near that route.
Hey guys! Lake near route 7 I saw a Gyarados!
Hurry it'll mega-evolve! The other one flew away and I was too late.
What route is best for small normal pokemon? My Skitty needs a friend.
Go to route 4, we're totally not on that path and we don't plan on catching your Skitty away from you.
