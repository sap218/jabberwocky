its a solar eclipse! you shouldnt look at it!
I forgot sunglasses...
You'll have a better chance at mars or the moon
It might be a good time of the year to see Venus though.
telescopes are crazy expensive...
Thank you for the information :-)
so who agrees that PLUTO is a planet?
its a dwarf planet #StillAPlanetToMe
Is the ISS fast? How about comets?
Did anyone know that our moon is called Luna?
does Earth have a name?
Did you know the Mars Rover sings Happy Birthday to celebrate the landing anniversary? #RoverFacts
anyone else believe in aliens? :o
what time of the year can I see the Big Dipper?
If you're in the UK then you can see it all year, but I guess it depends where you are because of light pollution.
It looks like a pan to me
Samee!
