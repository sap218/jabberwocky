what route is best for small normal pokemon my skitty needs a friend
go to route 4 were totally not on that path and we dont plan on catching your skitty away from you
anyone else dislike the new pokedex what happened to old fashioned gen 1
ive checked that route twice already i just want my caterpie to evolve already
ill join but we should move to the meadow area near that route
i think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path try route 2
anyone want a battle im on route 13
any small pokemon nearby i need to catch a metapod
hey guys lake near route 7 i saw a gyarados
