what route is best for small normal pokemon my skitty needs a friend
ive checked that route twice already i just want my caterpie to evolve already
currently on the opposite path training for brocks gym
i need one for my pokedex luckily im only a few minutes away i wont be too long just coming down the path now
remember to be careful everyone if you see any grunts of team rocket please notify us via your pokedex we are always alert on the path if you need assistance
any small pokemon nearby i need to catch a metapod
the path near the school is always a good choice
anyone want a battle im on route 13
go to route 4 were totally not on that path and we dont plan on catching your skitty away from you
anyone else dislike the new pokedex what happened to old fashioned gen 1
i think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path try route 2
ill join but we should move to the meadow area near that route
hey guys lake near route 7 i saw a gyarados
