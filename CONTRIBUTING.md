# Contributing Guildelines / Issues for Jabberwocky :dragon_face:

## Contributing Code
* If you intend to add a new feature or fix a bug, consider either creating an **Issue** or editing code directly and then opening a **Pull request**
* If suitable, I will work on the Issue or merge in
* Frequent contributors will be added to a contributors list for thanks and acknowledgement
* **Note**: code should be commented and include your username to acknowledge contribution, e.g.

```
print("Hello world") # example comment as a reference - @yourusername
``` 

## Issues
* Please don't hesitate to create an **Issue**
* Issues can relate to anything: error reporting, feature request, or questions for help, e.g.
* If the `README` isn't clear, please do report this! I encourage suggestions!
* Please add Issues with a clear title and as much information as possible, e.g.
* If reporting a bug, try to trace your steps and detail this (include error message, etc.)
* Please accept that sometimes information may not be fully understood or more detail is needed so most likely there will be follow-up questions
* I will label the issue accordingly see below for [`label`](https://github.com/sap218/jabberwocky/labels) information:

#### bug
* error reporting - any user problems will be tagged with `bug`

#### documentation
* pertains to Issues that can be solved by improving the documentation

#### duplicate
* although a question may have been asked before, don't hesitate to ask anyway - I'll label as `duplicate` and reference the solved/closed Issue

#### help
* this may be similar to `documentation` but rather this tag can include other things more general (e.g. a question about functions)

#### request
* this label highlights new features - users are encouraged to ask! 

#### wontfix
* this label covers all aspects of the repository: bugs, features, documentation, etc.
* there may be circumstances that a bug appears but a fix wouldn't make sense for Jabberwocky's scope
* after labelling as `wontfix` I will comment why, giving you a few days (perhaps to rebuttal) before I close the issue from lack of response/activity
* if I can help in any other way (e.g. linking to a different tool) I will try
* please accept this label: I will always try my best to meet the needs of the user but also considering what is best for Jabberwocky
